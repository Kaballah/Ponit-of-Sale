This is a simple Java Program created in Android Studio.
It is a simulation of a Point of Sale System which is used to capture the prices of items in the store, calculate their total, give a discount of 15% and provide a net total of all the items minus the discount.

I have recently intergreted a summury as an activity and it works perfectly fine.

The quantity of the items are limited to only 4 per item. So the system will only calculate upto the 4th item for all the items.
