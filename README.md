This is a simple Java Program created in Android Studio.
It is a simulation of a Point of Sale System which is used to capture the prices of items in the store, calculate their total, give a discount of 15% and provide a net total of all the items minus the discount.

I have recently intergreted a summury as an activity and it works perfectly fine.
The quantity of the items are limited to only 4 per item. So the system will only calculate upto the 4th item for all the items.

The android application has the following features;
    1. Capturing the quantity of the items.
    2. Ability to add and reduce any item upto the 4th item.
    3. Calculating the amount for each item.
    4. Calculating a 15% discount for all the items.
    5. Calculating the net total after the discount and giving out the total.
    6. It contains a summary page that displays a summary of the given items.
    
ENJOY THE SYSTEM ;)
